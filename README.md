## Instructions for exercise

The product team has come to you with a request for a new product. They want a web app that shows a listing of Faraday’s public GitHub repositories ([https://github.com/faradayio](https://github.com/faradayio)), powered by data from GitHub’s API.

There is no design spec for this yet, because it’s a last-minute thing, but you learn the following:

-   It should be easy for a user to sift through the repositories or find a specific repository they might be interested in.
-   Clicking a repository will take you to the repository’s page on GitHub.
-   There’s no design spec but it should have some basic styles.
-   Accessibility and responsiveness are important, but not critical.

You are encouraged to use React and Typescript to complete this app, but please do not take more than two hours. You may use whatever other libraries you wish. The app can be returned as a `.zip` file or as a GitHub repository.
